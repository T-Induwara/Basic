This little cascade has a deep plunge pool at its base that is extremely dangerous to swim. Kumari Ella gains its name Kumari that the daughter of King Rajasinghe | of Sitawaka who died by drowning threre. The waterfall of Kumari Ella is quite powerful despite its being of very low in height. The reason for this is because of very low in height. The reason for this is because the waterfall is created by four different streams joining near this point which later meets up with the major river Kelani.</p>
